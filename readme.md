Migration
Migrations are Djangoâ€™s way of propagating changes you make to your models into your database schema.
Run these commands whenever we make any changes to models.py
```
python manage.py makemigrations
```

```
python manage.py migrate
```

Open Django Shell
```
python manage.py shell
```
Shell Example:

```
In [1]: from products.models import Product

In [3]: Product.objects.all()
Out[3]: <QuerySet []>

In [5]: Product.objects.create( title = "Product1", description = "Product1 Description", price = "20", summary = "summary")  
Out[5]: <Product: Product object (1)>

In [6]: Product.objects.create( title = "Product1", description = "Product1 Description", price = "20", summary = "summary")  
Out[6]: <Product: Product object (2)>

In [7]: Product.objects.create( title = "Product1", description = "Product1 Description", price = "20", summary = "summary")  
Out[7]: <Product: Product object (3)>

In [8]: Product.objects.create( title = "Product1", description = "Product1 Description", price = "20", summary = "summary")  
Out[8]: <Product: Product object (4)>

In [9]: Product.objects.all()
Out[9]: <QuerySet [<Product: Product object (1)>, <Product: Product object (2)>, <Product: Product object (3)>, <Product: Product object (4)>]>

Serializer: used to convert complex model types into data types which can be used by python

For Model
```
from django.db import models

# Create your models here.

class Departments(models.Model):
    DepartmentId = models.AutoField(primary_key=True)
    DepartmentName = models.CharField(max_length=500)

class Employees(models.Model):
    EmployeeId = models.AutoField(primary_key=True)
    EmployeeName = models.CharField(max_length=500)
    Department = models.CharField(max_length=500)
    DateOfJoining = models.DateField()
    PhotoFileName = models.CharField(max_length=500)
```

Serializer definations would be

```
from rest_framework import serializers
from EmployeeApp.models import Departments,Employees

class DepartmentSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model=Departments 
        fields=('DepartmentId','DepartmentName')

class EmployeeSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model=Employees 
        fields=('EmployeeId','EmployeeName','Department','DateOfJoining','PhotoFileName')
```
